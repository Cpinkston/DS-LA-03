Here, you'll find links to slides, handouts, and other material.

### Key Dates

- March 4: First Day of Class

### Python and Data Science Resources

The class will be taught with Python 2.7. There's an ecosystem of Python tools we'll be using, listed below.

- [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do): A great place to start.

#### Intro to Python
- [Python at Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python): Browser-based interactive introduction

##### iPython and iPython Notebook
- [iPython](http://ipython.org/): A nicer interactive interface for Python 
- [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html): To create Python reports: 

##### Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)
- [Pandas Official Page](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Pandas Video Intro](http://vimeo.com/59324550)
- [Pandas Tutorial by Hernan Rojas](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas)

##### Scikit-Learn (Python Machine Learning Libraries)
- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Python Machine Learning Libraries

#### Code Editors
I mostly use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) but am not religious about it. If you're new to writing code, here are some recommended editors:
- [Sublime Text version 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) I'm starting to use this myself. Works on Mac / Windows / Linux
- [TextMate version 2](http://macromates.com/) Works on Mac only.
- [Pycharm version 3](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) This is a full-blown IDE (integreated development environment), and might be overkill. Works on Mac / Windows / Linux


#### Cloud-hosted Development Environments (Cloud IDEs)
I have no experience with these, but they look great. All you need is a web browser and you get to develop on a virtual server. You don't need to install any code editors. There are many options here, just Google for "Cloud IDE". To get you started, I've listed two: 

- [Koding](https://koding.com) I've used this briefly. You get root access to a virtual Linux server. Also great for collaborating.
- [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) This is what a several of the General Assembly Web Dev Immersive students are using. I haven't used it myself.

#### Intro to SQL and NoSQL Technologies

- [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page) Browser-based intro to SQL
- [Try MongoDB](http://try.mongodb.org/) Browser-based intro to MongoDB
- [Try Redis](http://try.redis.io) Browser-based intro to Redis
